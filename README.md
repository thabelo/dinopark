## Description

[Dinopark](https://dino.bluelink.com) Dino Park.

Our team divides the park into a 26 by 16 grid of zones. The letters A-Z represent the
columns and the numbers 0-15 represent the rows. For example, A13 is the first column and
the 14 th row.

● Each zone in the grid needs maintenance every 30 days.

● Maintenance staff can only perform maintenance in a zone when it is safe to do so

○ Safe means: No carnivores are in a zone or all carnivores in the zone are still
digesting their last meal (all dinosaurs in the park have an estimated digestion time
which is logged when the animal is first moved into the park)
